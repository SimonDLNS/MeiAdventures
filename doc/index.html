				<h2 id="who">Who am I?</h2>
					<p>
						Hello everyone, I'm Dr. Mei-Ling Zhou ! Your cheerful, creative, and optimistic world-renowned climatologist who has taken the fight to preserve the environment into her own hands. I specialize in the study of abnormal climate phenomena and their effects on different ecosystems around the world. I strongly believes in preserving the world for future generations, and am determined to fight for a better future. I know that sounds really boring, but I'll do my best to make it entertaining! While originally just a scientist, Winston's recall order has inspired me. I'm also a huge fan of Lúcio's music.

						So I'm starting this journal. Honestly, I'm not sure who's going to want to read this. It was the idea of my colleague, Winston. He thinks that people will find my "unique" perspective interesting. (We'll see if he's right!) At the very least, it'll help me pass the time, and believe me, when you're huddled in a shelter and it's -20° C outside (brrrr!), you have a lot of time to kill. (And 雪球 isn't the greatest conversationalist.)

						<h3 id="earlyresearch">Early Research</h3>
							<p>
								During my years in climatology, I, Dr. Mei-Ling Zhou, encountered a number of "obstinate anti-intellectualists." At some point, I attended a climatology conference. I introduced cutting-edge innovations in the field of climate manipulation that protected at-risk areas in Asia and beyond.</p>
						<h3 id="ecopoint">Ecopoint: Antarctica</h3>	

							<p>
								Though many blamed the planet's escalating, unexplained climate phenomena on the advent of new technologies, the rapidly growing omnic population, and drastically increased consumption of resources, the true cause remained unknown. To find a solution, Overwatch established a series of eco-Watchpoints at remote, critical locations worldwide.<br>

								I was a member of this multi-year initiative. A peerless climatologist, I was assigned to the program's monitoring station at Watchpoint: Antarctica. An atmospheric anomaly above Antarctica was the basis of the base's research, but then, disaster struck: a sudden, catastrophic polar storm battered the installation and cut it off from the outside world, leaving the facility damaged and the scientists stranded. As their supplies dwindled, they entered cryostasis in a last-ditch effort to survive until a rescue attempt could be made. Before entering cryo, I made a recording, anticipating waking up and finding a wealth of data to examine (as I left the sensors on).

								Nine years passed before I woke up, not a physical day older due to being in cryo. My cryo pod was reactivated once the base received an external message, albeit too weak to properly display on the base's terminals. Alongside Snowball (the base's droid), I got dressed, made tea, and looked at the data I'd collected, discovering that the anomaly was much worse than predicted. Snowball revealed that I've been in stasis for nine years, much to my horror; surely Overwatch would have come for us in that time. I tried to communicate with the outside world, but the comms were down. The base however, had accumulated news reports over the years the comms were active, which revealed that in the interim, the Ecopoint had been considered lost in the ice storm, and Overwatch had been shut down. No one knew we were here. It was at this point that I began to wonder where my fellow researchers were, and rushed back to the cryo-chamber. I discovered that all of the pods bar, my own had malfunctioned, and as a result, they had perished. I broke down crying, alone in the base, with only Snowball for company. I promised to get the data we'd collected to the world. Or at least try.

								I headed outside. However, the dish was broken (which prevented any outgoing transmissions), the base's vehicles were incapacitated, and looking out across the vast Antarctic landscape quickly discouraged any thoughts of hiking out. I went back inside, faced with isolation (bar Snowball), and the knowledge that the base's power wouldn't last indefinitely. I noticed the transmission that had been sent earlier, one that was being sent over Overwatch's emergency frequency. Perhaps someone knew we were here, but to find out, we'd need to reinforce the radio tower so I could climb it and access the dish. Over the next several days, I scavenged material to build an endothermic blaster and a makeshift antenna. I nearly completed it, but it was at this point that the base's last battery gave out. Snowball sacrificed his own power to recharge my workstation, and as such, I was able to finish the blaster. Through it, I was able to use its ice properties to climb the tower and get to the dish. Using my antenna, I discovered that the message had been sent from Winston, urging Overwatch's former agents to get back together to face the troubles facing their world. I decided to answer the call. Before leaving, I paid my final respects to my friends before taking a sled of supplies, and hiked across the Antarctic landscape with confidence. To my joy, I found that Snowball (whom I've taken with me) had regained his power, thanks to a portable solar panel I had taken with me.

						<h3 id="newworld">A New World</h3>
							<p>
								People look at me like I'm crazy when I say I miss Antarctica. Yes, it was cold. Yes, it was lonely. But the scenery... I've never seen anything like it! There's a mountain range called Wolf's Jaw, in Queen Maud Land... Stone spikes, thousands of feet high, jutting from that featureless white expanse... That was Captain Opara's favorite place. Some day, when this is all over, I want to go back.<br>

								I found myself awakened to a world that had undergone considerable changes. Not only was Overwatch no more, but the serious climate issues had worsened, and none of the eco-watchpoints were in operation. Any clues that we had uncovered were lost. I decided to continue my work on my own. Equipped with a portable version of my climate-manipulation technology, I traveled around the world, hoping to re-establish the eco-network and track down the causes of the threats to the planet's ecosystem.<br>

								Despite my ordeal in Antarctica, I still missed the continent, and hoped to return to it someday.

								At some point I rescued a nest of endangered Arctic wildlife from a collapsing glacier using my technology. My deeds were reported on by Olympia Shaw.

						<h4 id="moreadventures">More Adventures</h4>
							<p>
								At some point after this, I got in touch with Winston. He suggested I start writing a journal, telling me that people would find my "unique" perspective interesting. I made my first journal entry and made it available to the public while in the Yukon near Mount Logan, while testing my new gear. I concluded that it was in working order (a step up from a few days ago, when I've accidentally frozen my arm), and began studying the local wildlife. Six days later, I decided to head to Asia, to investigate the abandoned Overwatch stations there. Before doing so, I took a break by flying into Los Angeles to see Six-Gun Killer. Two days after that, I was in Asia, investigating a mountain ecosystem.
